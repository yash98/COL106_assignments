2. Windows: 
   Some students are facing problems while compiling a program on Windows.
   Mostly, these problems relate to encoding issues. 
   There are two solutions to this problem: 
   a. Compile your programs with encoding flag : javac -encoding UTF8 program.java
   b. Change the encoding of your java file to ascii/UTF8 : open program with notepad++ editor, and change its encoding to ascii/UTF8

   In our experience, the Notepad++ (open source) editor on windows manages the indentation of the 
   java source files correctly.
